## Overview

<a href="#">FlowAlgo for macOS</a> caters to traders who pay close attention to options flow and dark pool prints as a leading indicator of positioning. Instead of manually scanning raw tape, the platform surfaces sweeps, large blocks and unusual activity in a digestible stream. Filtering by symbol, size, expiration or sentiment lets users zero in on flows that match their timeframe and strategy. This turns a noisy firehose of data into a curated signal feed.

The interface highlights context as much as the prints themselves. Charts, recent flow history and key stats help traders judge whether a specific order aligns with an ongoing theme or stands out as an outlier. With <a href="#">custom alerts and watchlists</a>, users can keep tabs on favourite tickers or sectors even while focusing on other tasks. Visual cues such as colour, grouping and relative size make it easier to spot persistent directional activity versus one-off hedges.

On macOS, FlowAlgo is designed to run alongside charting and execution platforms without demanding too much screen space. Traders might pin it to a side monitor or keep it as a narrow column that scrolls in real time. Over long sessions, this constant awareness of flow can help validate setups, warn of shifting sentiment or inspire fresh ideas that pure price-based analysis might miss.
